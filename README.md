# Flèche Vertical
Forked from and entirely inspired by the brilliant [Flèche](https://github.com/hdni/Fleche) theme by hdni. 
I just added vertical tabs styling to his firefox theme.

### Firefox
* Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) extension.
* Install the [FXChrome](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxchrome/) theme.
* Install the [Vertical Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs/) extension.
* Go to your [Add-ons Manager](about:addons), select the User Styles page and then write a new style.
* Give the style a name and paste the contents of firefox.css.
* Restart firefox at least once before reporting any issues! :)

## Notes
* This theme is not complete yet, and still has bugs. If you find any, please use the issues tracker!
