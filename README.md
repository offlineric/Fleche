# Flèche Vertical
Forked from and entirely inspired by the brilliant [Flèche](https://github.com/hdni/Fleche) theme by hdni. 
I just added vertical tabs styling to his firefox theme.

### Firefox
* Install the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) extension.
* Install the [FXChrome](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxchrome/) theme.
* Install the [Vertical Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/vertical-tabs/) extension.
* Go to your [Add-ons Manager](about:addons), select the User Styles page and then write a new style.
* Give the style a name and paste the contents of firefox.css.
* Restart firefox at least once before reporting any issues! :)

### Autohiding variant
* To have the navbar autohide like the tab bar: 
* Also Install the [lesschrome modified](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/lesschrome-modified/) extension.
* And the [toolbar autohide](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fullscreen-toolbar-hover) extension.
* Also designed to have the home button directly before the urlbar otherwise those will look strange.

### Tooltips titles variant
* Should be the same as autohiding.

## Notes
* This theme is not complete yet, and still has bugs. If you find any, please feel free to fix them yourself ;) and send me your patches.
* To resize history or various other panels you have to remove the last line of the style (#splitter {display none})
